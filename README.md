# Roman Numerals Decoder

I won't tell the whole details or share the code (soon, I will). However, I would love to guide you how I did it.

I have used Lua runtime, [Luvit](https://github.com/luvit).

How I did it? It's pretty simple. I made a io-read, then pass the string to a decoded function, which returns the total numbers.

The symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, respectively 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000.
